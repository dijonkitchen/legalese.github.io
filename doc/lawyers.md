## Generating English from Formal Grammars (Isomorphism)
There exists a lovely framework for generating multi-lingual natural language from formal grammars.  It's called GrammaticalFramework.  As a lawyer, you'll probably be good at generating the appropriate natural language. The plan is to build a dictionary of translation of the smallest "atomic" units of logic to legal, then compose these fragments into larger texts.
