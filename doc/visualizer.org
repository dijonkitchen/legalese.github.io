Let's look at some conversion scenarios:

* Scenarios
** Next Qualifying Financing
- company raises funds
- && the instrument is an equity instrument
- && the funds raised are above /a certain threshold/.

** Next Nonqualifying Financing
*** instrument is not an equity instrument.
*** the funds raised are below a certain threshold.

** Maturity
on or after the maturity date, (at the election of the investor,)
- company must repay /(a certain multiple of)/ the principal invested, OR
- the instrument converts to common at a /maturity_conversion_discount/ to the valuation cap

** Sale prior to conversion
prior to conversion, the company gets acquired.

the investor gets to decide whether to
- get paid back their LP (with participation, if that was agreed)
- convert to common

Meng would like to introduce the idea of an Acquisition Preference that can be a different number than an LP.

** Dissolution prior to conversion

Either the investor

*** converts to common and participates alongside common, or
*** gets back (LPx) the principal invested, or
*** if they negotiated participation, they do both.
