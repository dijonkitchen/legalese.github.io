# Decompiler

The Decompiler reads an existing Legalese 1.0 document and constructs, to the best of its abilty, a DSL that matches it.

Conceptually the reverse of the Compiler, it would be interesting to round-trip a Legalese 1.0 document (in the wild) through Legalese to see whether the 2nd-generation output is semantically identical.
