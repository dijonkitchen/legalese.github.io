* Random Ideas

To take away the fear of TLDR maybe we can like Medium say "this workflow will take 3 minutes of understanding and 2 minutes of execution".

Like how recipes do it -- 20 minutes prep, 10 minutes cook.

* Why is it hard to domesticate a customer?

we need them to know, use, trust, and pay us.

** Don't know

didn't know the tool exists. didn't search for it. need viral / WOM? need common "first-tier tech support" people to know about us and refer to us? online, quora will be a source of referrals; we can also do inbound content marketing. and we can get our friends at ACE and BANSEA and TIE and the angel community to know about us. Media coverage will be a useful part of this.

** Don't use / don't like

UI / UX challenge -- the interface is intimidating. Maybe we should A/B/C test the following:

*** the spreadsheet interface

*** the wizard interface (like clerky)

*** the fill-in-the-doc WYSIWYG interface (like docracy and lawcanvas and legal.cf.sg)

** Don't trust

at the end of the day, need a human to reassure.

need some kind of authority to give a stamp of approval.

like, sick? go to doctor. even if it's a cold and there's nothing modern medicine can do for you. still need the MC.

some kind of persuasion:

*** social proof

but the risk here is the feeling that "oh, but every case is different, even if it worked for this other company, i am not 100% the same as that company."

in medicine, it's the idea that 98% of the time, it's a cold. 2% of the time, it's MERS.

so, we conclude from here that most people don't want to pay a lawyer $2000 to draft something from scratch.

*** authority

so you need a doctor to review it and bless it. and they might be able to do that for $500.

** Don't pay

we shall deal with this [[file:revenue.org][later]].



* Acquisition: Interested User Encounters Legalese

User might remember Legalese from seeing it at the bottom of some other legal agreement they signed in the last couple of years.

User has experienced a trigger event which gives rise to a pain point:

** hiring a new employee
*** now needs an employment agreement and a corresponding ESOP
what they don't know:

if the ESOP is being set up for the first time, might need an alteration to the articles, and all the consents that that implies.

if the employee is getting shares, and if there exists a shareholders agreement, then the new employee might also need a dora, lol.

** hiring a new cofounder
*** now needs a vesting agreement and to extend the shareholder agreement

** angel round fundraising

*** now needs what futurebooks calls a "secretarial rescue"
*** bring the company into good standing with the government
*** prepare all needed financial accounts
**** submit for audit if necessary
*** file all outstanding AGMs
*** all the due diligence needed for a semi-professional investment
**** employment contracts
**** nondisclosure
**** IP assignment
**** etc

** do an AGM

* Directors

// section in the Constitution
var directors = Array(5);

directors[0] = "Bob";
directors[1] = "Chuck";
directors[2] = "Dick";
directors[3] = "Ed";
directors[4] = "Lian";

directors.resolve([...]);

directors[3] = undefined;
directors[3] = "Pat";

function addDirector(candidate) {
  if (this.allowedToAddDirector(candidate)) { // guard or precondition
    this.directors[3] = candidate;
  } else {
    // log that there is drama
  }
}

function allowedToAddDirector(candidate) {
  return majorityShareholders.vote("allow adding " + candidate);
}


* Activation: Gem Install

For the hackers who want to take a totally self-help approach to this, gem install some kind of software package that's configurable with JSON to produce CSV for Legalese and eventually outputs PDFs.
